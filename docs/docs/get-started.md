# Get Started

- **Supported OS**: PyCharming currently only supports **MacOS**, though it should also work for any other platform that provides a working [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) implementation. It soon will support **Windows** and run in **Modern Browsers**.
- **Python**: 3.6/3.7/3.8

```bash
$ pip3 install charming --user
```

## 📺 A Simple Example

```python
'''rect.py'''
import charming as cm

# draw a rect
cm.full_screen()
cm.rect(0, 0, 10, 10)

# run the sketch
cm.run()
```

```bash
$ python3 rect.py
```
